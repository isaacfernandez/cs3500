For this project, we were given the views and model interfaces of kernanr and mrascati. Our goal
was to adapt our model and controller to work with their view.

We encountered some problems while adapting our code. In their views (specfically the files
ConcreteGuiViewPanel and ConsoleView), they leaked implementation details in several places by
creating "NoteImpl"s, their implementation of note, and using a static method on Piece, their
implementation of music model, called "sortNotesByPitch(notesAtBeat)". We emailed several times
(December 5, December 7, and December 9) asking them to change this (as we were unable to compile
their code due to it), but we never received any changed files. As a result, we were unable to
avoid making changes to their code. We have uploaded a change log of the changes we needed to make,
both to their code and to ours to document this (as well as leaving comments in the code).

Another problem we encountered was the absence of a view that combines the GUI and MIDI views. This
was not sent to us initially. We requested it and got a message that said they do not have that
view created. This made working with that particular view impossible, so we worked instead on
adapting our code for the GUI and MIDI views individually. They also did not have any method declarations
in their interface that was specifically for GUI views (GuiViewInterface), and did not actually
implement that interface anywhere (instead using ViewInterface for all of their views).

A third problem we encountered was the absence of certain methods in their GUI code. The methods
playPiece, playBeat, and playFromBeat on GuiViewFrame were all void and empty. All of the other
GUI views also had playFromBeat empty. As there was no documentation in ViewInterface as to exactly
what each of those methods is supposed to do, and why they might be empty in certain classes. There
was also missing documentation for a few other methods outside in other interfaces.
